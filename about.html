	ABOUT US
	</h2>
	<h3>
	Our goal is to provide people with the education they need to succeed in a career in computer programming through
	bootcamp style weeks-long coding courses. We'll work with you to understand what corporations expect and how to function
	in a startup-style app development team. You'll get experience working as a group including team meetings, feedback
	and the implementing of bug fixes to your code. You'll learn about when to use agile development, how to handle waterfall development
	and get experience with the entire product lifecycle from minimum viable product to production role-out and 
	ongoing enhancments. Coming out of our course you will be able to immediately begin taking short-term programming 
	gigs and start to build your new career. 
	<BR><BR>
	We would also like to be a local resource in North East Pennsylvania for tech culture, including demos of things 
	like neural networks, 3D Printers, virtual reality, lectures about cryptocurrency
	and fun stuff like board and role-playing games. We will have free talks and demos from local resource experts 
	that will include drinks and (amazing) pizza from local restaurants. Check our schedule page or sign up to receive 
	new event alerts on our contact page.

	Our founder has twenty-five years of experience as a computer programmer for various corporations in New York City. More 
	recently he has worked as a consulant for startups implementing phone apps. He has also taught inexperienced 
	students at Florida State Universtity as well as at CUNY in NYC. In the bowels of corporate America he has 
	led teams of interns and consultants, shepherding their understanding of on-site coding practices. He is a big
	proponent of breaking up the strangle hold the cities have on programming jobs. The rise of work-from-home, remote
	offices and home-sourcing has finally made this possible.
	<BR><BR>
	Be prepared for the coming tech sprawl.
